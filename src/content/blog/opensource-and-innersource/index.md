In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, collaboration is key to driving innovation and staying ahead of the curve. Two prominent models that have emerged to foster collaboration in software development are open source and innersource. While both share a common foundation in collaborative principles, they differ in their scope and application. Let's delve into the worlds of open source and inner source, exploring their benefits, differences, and how they are shaping the future of software development.

Open Source refers to assets that are available over a public domain that can be accessed, modified, inspected, enhanced and/or redistributed anyone. In tech and software it applies for source code. There are various [open source initiative approved licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses) that govern various aspects of what can and cannot be done, but the general idea is allow innovation by sharing in open.

Innersource is applying the open source principles and practices within a company, typically for properiatary projects. [Innersource Commons](https://innersourcecommons.org/) is trying to bring together patterns and use cases to better define and educate people about use and adoption of innersource.

There is one general misconception about Open Source ang it is associated with a monetary value attached to it. It comes from the term Free and Open Source Software where the word "free" was meant to be in the sense of freedom, not in the sense of no cost. Most open source software are now either funded or owned by large coporations, and the most active or main maintainers of the project work for that company. We are here because somewhere, somehow we had this wild expectation that these amazing people building these awesome software for us should do it for no money. 

A [recent blog I read in linkedin](https://blog.gitbutler.com/the-future-of-open-source/) has explained very well the history and the source of the confusion, and also proposed the use of the term "**_fair source_**" to indicate such projects.

## The power of Open Source
Open source software, as the name suggests, refers to software whose source code is publicly available. This means anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance the code, fostering a global community of developers who collaborate to improve and innovate.

### Community-Driven Innovation
The open nature of the code allows developers worldwide to contribute their expertise, leading to rapid problem-solving and the development of robust and reliable software. This collaborative approach has given rise to some of the most widely used technologies today.

### Transparency and Security
The open source model promotes transparency, as the code is open for scrutiny by anyone. This can lead to the early identification and resolution of security vulnerabilities, resulting in more secure and reliable software.

> The impact of open source is undeniable, with projects like the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the WordPress content management system powering a significant portion of the internet.

> Did you know that the Linux kernel is used in a vast majority of web servers and Android devices?

## Collaboration within the walls
Innersource takes the principles of open source and applies them within the confines of a company or organization. It encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among internal teams, often working on proprietary projects.

### Leveraging Open Source Principles
By adopting innersource practices, companies can break down silos between teams, promote code reuse, and streamline development processes. This leads to faster development cycles and higher-quality software.

### Fostering a Culture of Innovation
Innersource empowers employees by giving them a sense of ownership and encouraging them to contribute to projects beyond their immediate team. This fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

> Companies like Google, IBM, and PayPal have successfully implemented innersource practices, reaping the benefits of increased collaboration and efficiency.

## Key Differences and Similarities
While both models emphasize collaboration, there are some key distinctions:

- **Target Audience**: Open source is open to the public, while innersource is limited to an organization's internal teams.
- **Licensing**: Open source projects typically use permissive licenses (e.g. MIT, Apache), allowing for broad use and modification. Innersource projects may have stricter licensing terms to protect intellectual property.
- **Shared Principles**: Both models promote collaboration, transparency, and meritocracy, valuing contributions based on merit rather than hierarchy.

Deciding between open source and innersource depends on various factors, including project goals, intellectual property concerns, and company culture. Open source is ideal for projects that benefit from a large community of contributors, while innersource is better suited for proprietary projects or those requiring stricter control.

## Choosing the Right Approach
Open source and innersource are powerful collaborative models that are driving innovation and shaping the future of software development. Whether you're contributing to a global open source project or advocating for innersource within your organization, embracing collaboration is key to unlocking the full potential of software development.

There is always a chance that an innersourced project at your organization decides to make it open source. There are many such examples we've seen in the past and even today there's no shortage of that happening.

Additionally, with the introduction of fair source as linked in the blog above, I think open source maintaners have an option of good balance of developing in the open while also protecting the intellectual property for a period. The adoption of such principles may certainly increase collaboration and innovation while keeping the lights on.

Are you ready to embrace the power of collaboration? Explore open source projects that align with your interests or champion innersource initiatives within your company. If you go to github and find projects with a tag `good first issue`, you'll find hundreds if not thousands of repos that are accepting contributions. Someone even made a [website](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) for this. 

The future of software development is collaborative, and the opportunities are endless!
