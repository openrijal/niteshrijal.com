Today, I'm thrilled to announce the launch of something I'm incredibly passionate about: **[Parents in Tech](https://parentsintech.org/)** - a global community that bridges the gap between technology expertise and parenting, creating a space where we can leverage our skills to build a better future for our children.

## The Vision Behind Parents in Tech

As a parent working in tech, I've often found myself wondering how I could use my technical skills to create meaningful educational experiences for my children. I know I'm not alone in this thought. Across the globe, there are thousands of tech-savvy parents who share this same passion for combining their professional expertise with their desire to nurture and educate the next generation.

That's exactly why **Parents in Tech** was born.

## Our Mission: More Than Just Code

Our mission is simple yet ambitious: **To unite parents in the tech industry, fostering a collaborative community where we leverage our expertise to create innovative, open-source projects that inspire and educate children, while championing a balanced approach to tech careers and family life.**

But we're not just about building apps and tools. We're about:

### ü§ù Building Community & Collaboration
- Creating a vibrant network where tech parents can connect, share experiences, and support each other
- Facilitating collaborative development of open-source projects specifically designed for children
- Establishing a platform for exchanging technical expertise, parenting insights, and best practices

### üõ†Ô∏è Project Development & Impact
- Developing engaging, age-appropriate educational tools that foster children's learning
- Enhancing digital literacy through practical tools that help children safely interact with technology
- Inspiring future innovators by sparking curiosity and encouraging STEM exploration
- Showcasing how collaborative, open-source development can create invaluable resources for families worldwide

### ‚öñÔ∏è Work-Life Integration
- Providing a creative outlet where parents can apply professional skills to meaningful family-aligned projects
- Supporting balanced lifestyles with flexible, understanding environments that accommodate both tech careers and parenting demands

## Ambitious Goals for 2025

We're not thinking small. Here's what we're aiming to achieve by the end of 2025:

### üåç Build Community
**Goal: 1,000 members strong**
We want to create a vibrant, global community of parents from around the world. Every voice matters, every perspective adds value, and every parent brings unique skills to the table.

### üì± Build Catalog
**Goal: 100 functional apps**
We're building a comprehensive catalog of functional applications and proof-of-concepts, leveraging free quotas from various services to keep costs low and accessibility high.

### üöÄ Build Superapp
**Goal: Multi-platform superapp**
Our ambitious vision includes creating a multi-platform superapp that houses our entire catalog, allowing families to access mini-apps seamlessly across Play Store, App Store, and web browsers.

## Why This Matters Now

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's more important than ever that we intentionally shape how our children interact with technology. Rather than leaving this to chance or to companies whose primary motivation might not align with our values as parents, we have the opportunity‚Äîand I'd argue, the responsibility‚Äîto create educational tools and experiences that truly serve our families.

**Parents in Tech** isn't just about building software; it's about building a legacy. It's about ensuring that the next generation has access to thoughtful, educational, and inspiring technology that helps them not just consume content, but create, innovate, and solve problems.

## The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. Over the coming months, you'll see us launching our first set of projects, building out our community platform, and creating resources that make it easier for tech parents to contribute meaningfully to their children's digital education.

I believe that when passionate, skilled parents come together with a shared vision, we can create something truly extraordinary. We can build tools that don't just entertain our children, but educate them. We can create experiences that don't just occupy their time, but inspire their futures.

## Join Us

If you're a parent in tech‚Äîor know someone who is‚ÄîI invite you to join us on this journey. Together, we can build a community that celebrates the unique blend of parenting and technology, creating a better digital future for our children and families around the world.

Let's build the future, one family at a time.
