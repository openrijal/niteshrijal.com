Parents in Tech is a global community that bridges the gap between technology expertise and parenting. It provides a space where parents can leverage their skills to build a better future for their children by creating innovative, open-source projects.

The community's mission is to unite parents in the tech industry, fostering collaboration on engaging, age-appropriate educational tools. It aims to enhance digital literacy and inspire future innovators by making technology accessible and educational for families worldwide.

By 2025, the community aims to grow to 1,000 members, build a catalog of 100 functional apps, and launch a multi-platform superapp to house the entire collection.
